# Deployment
The app is deployed in the following Hugging Face [space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/balaustrada/UFCPredictor), allowing for the prediction of fights by including the event date, fighter names and the odds assigned for each fighter.

If you want to deploy you own, you can follow the following guidelines:

## Input data

In order to successfully deploy the prediction model, data needs to be downloaded and stored in a local folder. This data is expected to follow the structure defined in [balaustrada/ufcscraper](https://github.com/), with the following tables:
- ``event_data.csv``
- ``fighter_data.csv``
- ``fight_data.csv``
- ``round_data.csv``
- ``fighter_names.csv``
- ``BestFightOdds_odds.csv``

Alternatively, data can be downloaded on the fly if a Hugging Face token to the repo ``datasets/UFCfightdata`` is provided (currently a private repo).

## Local installation
Install ``ufcscraper`` and ``ufcpredictor`` (tested for ``python==3.12``):
```bash
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/balaustrada/ufcscraper.git
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/balaustrada/ufcpredictor.git
```

### Run (without UFCfightdata token)
In this case you need to specify the data folder where the ``csv`` files are stored, and the model: 
```bash
ufcpredictor_app --data-folder data --model-path models/model.pth
```
The model can be accessed in ``http://localhost:7860``.


### Run (with UFCfightdata token)
In this case you need specify the data folder where the data will be downloaded into, but also the token and the model:
```bash
export DATASET_TOKEN=DATASETTOKEN; ufcpredictor_app --data-folder data --model-path models/model.pth --download-dataset
```
The model can be accessed in ``http://localhost:7860``.


## Deployment with Docker

### Include data (without UFCfightdata token)
We need to modify the Dockerfile uncommenting and editing the following line to include the folder where the ``csv`` files are stored. (Remember Dockerfile will only work with folders inside the relative path).
```dockerfile
#ADD --chown=user data_folder $HOME/app/data
```
We should also modify the last line to remove the ``--download-dataset`` option:
```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py", "--data-folder", "data", "--model-path", "models/model.pth", "--port", "7860", "--server-name", "0.0.0.0",]
```

### Include data (with token)
To include the data we only to set the environmental variable ``DATASET_TOKEN`` in our Dockerfile or at runtime.

### Build image
The first step to deploy with Docker is to **build the image**. We need first to modify the Dockerfile uncommenting and editing the line:
```bash
docker build -t ufcpredictor:latest .
```

### Run container (without token)
```bash
docker run -p 7860:7860 ufcpredictor
```
The model can be accessed in ``http://localhost:7860``.

### Run container (with token)
```bash
docker run -e DATASET_TOKEN=DATASET_TOKEN -p 7860:7860 ufcpredictor
```
The model can be accessed in ``http://localhost:7860``.
