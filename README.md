# Deployment
## Input data

In order to successfully deploy the prediction model, data needs to be downloaded and stored in a local folder. This data is expected to follow the structure defined in [balaustrada/ufcscraper](https://github.com/), with the following tables:
- ``event_data.csv``
- ``fighter_data.csv``
- ``fight_data.csv``
- ``round_data.csv``
- ``fighter_names.csv``
- ``BestFightOdds_odds.csv``

Alternatively, data can be downloaded on the fly if a Hugging Face token to the repo ``datasets/UFCfightdata`` is provided (currently a private repo).

## Local installation
Install ``ufcscraper`` and ``ufcpredictor``:
```bash
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/balaustrada/ufcscraper.git
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/balaustrada/ufcpredictor.git
```

### Run (without UFCfightdata token)
In this case you need to specify the data folder (and the model): 
```bash
ufcpredictor_app --data-folder data --model-path models/model.pth
```

### Run (with UFCfightdata token)
In this case you specify the data folder where the data will be downloaded into, but also the token and.
```bash
export DATASET_TOKEN=DATASETTOKEN; ufcpredictor_app --data-folder data --model-path models/model.pth --download-dataset
```

## Deployment with Docker

### Include data (without UFCfightdata token)
We need to modify the Dockerfile uncommenting and editing the following line to include the folder where the ``csv`` files are stored.
```dockerfile
#ADD --chown=user /path/to/data/folder $HOME/app/data
```
We should also modify the last line to remove the ``--download-dataset`` option:
```dockerfile
CMD ["python", "app.py", "--data-folder", "data", "--model-path", "models/model.pth", "--port", "7860", "--server-name", "0.0.0.0",]
```

### Include data (with token)
To include the data we only to set the environmental variable ``DATASET_TOKEN`` in our Dockerfile or at runtime.

### Build image
The first step to deploy with Docker is to **build the image**. We need first to modify the Dockerfile uncommenting and editing the line:
```bash
docker build -t ufcpredictor:latest .
```

### Run container
```bash
docker run ufcpredictor:latest
```

The model can be accessed in ``http://localhost:7860``.
